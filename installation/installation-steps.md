After launching the virtual machine with the Kali Linux ISO attached, the system will boot into the Kali Linux installer menu (BIOS mode).
Here, you are presented with several installation options:
- Graphical install – Launches the installation process with a user-friendly graphical interface.
- Install – Starts a text-based installation (no GUI).
- Advanced options – Contains additional boot and setup parameters.
- Accessible dark contrast installer menu – Provides a high-contrast visual mode for accessibility.
- Install with speech synthesis – Enables spoken feedback during installation.

For most users, the recommended option is “Graphical install”, as it provides an easier and more intuitive setup experience.
Use the arrow keys to highlight “Graphical install” and press Enter to continue.

In this step, the installer asks you to choose the language for your Kali Linux installation.
This setting determines the language used for the installation process and the default system language after setup.
For this installation, English was selected.
Choosing English ensures that all menus, system messages, and default configurations are displayed in English, which is recommended for most users and documentation purposes.
